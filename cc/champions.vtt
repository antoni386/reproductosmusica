00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.300
I've paid my dues

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.800
Time after time.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.200
I've done my sentence

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.700
But committed no crime.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.100
And bad mistakes

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.900
I've made a few.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.800
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.400
But I've come through.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.700
(And I need just go on and on, and on, and on)

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:44.300
We are the champions, my friends,

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:52.100
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.600
We are the champions.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.400
We are the champions.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.900
No time for losers

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:17.300
'Cause we are the champions of the world.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.800
I've taken my bows

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.600
And my curtain calls.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.300
You brought me fame and fortune,
and everything that goes with it.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.000
I thank you all.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.100
But it's been no bed of roses,

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.500
No ******** cruise.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.600
I consider it a challenge
before the whole human race,

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.100
And I ain't gonna lose.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.300
(And I need just go on and on, and on, and on)

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:00.300
We are the champions, my friends,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.200
We are the champions.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.000
We are the champions.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.600
No time for losers

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.100
'Cause we are the champions of the world.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.300
We are the champions, my friends,

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:40.100
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.900
We are the champions.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.700
We are the champions.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.200
No time for losers

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.500
'Cause we are the champions.
